Renewal invoices are issued **each May** for quota licenses and **45 days** before quarter close for SRX licenses. Payments received after the due date incur a 10% penalty for the first 10 days and 15% thereafter. If your license lapses, you must cease sales immediately and follow the escalation path outlined in the renewal services section.
