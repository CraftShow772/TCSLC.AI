The application bootstraps a production-grade Next.js 14 project using the App Router, strict TypeScript 5.4 settings, and pnpm-managed scripts. Core dependencies are pinned for reproducibility, and Turbopack is enabled for fast local feedback. The layout primitives, font loading strategy, and design tokens are defined globally so subsequent prompts can extend them without rework.
