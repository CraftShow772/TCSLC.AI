## Renewal windows

Renewal notices are issued **90 days** before expiration. Submit the renewal package at least 30 days prior to allow for compliance review and background processing.

- Upload the dram shop insurance certificate dated within the renewal year.
- Confirm the Registered Agent on file matches current business officers.
- Use the ACH payment option to avoid credit card convenience fees.

## Escalation path

If the license lapses, contact the **Regional Administrator** within ten days and schedule an expedited inspection. Late fees escalate weekly, so document all communication in the audit log.
