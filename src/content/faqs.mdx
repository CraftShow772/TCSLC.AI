# Frequently Asked Questions

## How long will my case take?

Processing times vary by case type, agency workload, and the completeness of documentation. During intake we set expectations and share official processing time resources.

## What documents should I bring to my consultation?

Bring government-issued identification, immigration records, notices from USCIS or the Department of State, and any court documents. A detailed checklist will accompany the final content import.

## Do you offer virtual meetings?

Yes. We support secure video consultations and remote document collaboration to keep cases moving without requiring in-person visits.

## How do professional fees work?

We quote fixed or milestone-based fees for most matters, outlining what is included and when payments are due.
