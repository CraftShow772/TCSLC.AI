# Professional Fees

Our office provides transparent pricing so clients understand the total investment before a case begins. Detailed fee schedules will be populated when the official content migration is complete.

## Flat Fees

We rely on flat-fee structures for most family-based petitions and naturalization matters to simplify budgeting.

## Payment Plans

Flexible payment plans allow clients to pay in installments tied to key case milestones.

## Additional Costs

Government filing fees, translation services, and medical exams are billed separately and are subject to change by third-party providers.
